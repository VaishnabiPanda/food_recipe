    <h1> Chana Madra</h1>
    <p>Chana Madra is a creamy curry made with chickpeas and yogurt, flavored with mild spices. Soak 1 cup of kabuli chana (white chickpeas) overnight, then boil until soft. In a pan, heat mustard oil, add cumin seeds, cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaf. Add 1 cup thick whisked yogurt slowly, stirring constantly on low heat to prevent curdling. Once the yogurt thickens and starts releasing oil, add boiled chickpeas and salt.

Cook the mixture on low flame, adding garam masala, turmeric, and coriander powder. Let it simmer until the gravy becomes thick and creamy. Garnish with chopped coriander and serve hot with steamed rice or roti. Chana Madra is a staple of Himachali dham (feast) and showcases the state’s love for yogurt-based gravies.
