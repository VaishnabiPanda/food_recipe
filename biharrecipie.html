    <h1> Litti Chokha</h1>
    <p>
        Litti is made by preparing a dough with wheat flour, salt, ajwain (carom seeds), and a little ghee. The stuffing is made from sattu (roasted gram flour), mixed with finely chopped onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies, coriander leaves, lemon juice, mustard oil, salt, and a pinch of ajwain. The dough is stuffed with the sattu mixture, shaped into balls, and traditionally roasted over coal or baked in an oven until golden brown. Brushing the hot littis with ghee enhances flavor and authenticity.

Chokha is a mashed vegetable side dish typically made with roasted eggplant (baingan), boiled potatoes, or tomatoes. The roasted/boiled vegetables are peeled and mashed, then mixed with mustard oil, chopped onions, garlic, green chilies, coriander, and salt. Served together, Litti Chokha is a wholesome, earthy meal packed with smoky, spicy, and tangy flavors.

<h1>Dal Pitha</h1>
<p>
 Dal Pitha is Bihari-style dumplings made with rice flour and a spiced chana dal filling. First, soak 1 cup of chana dal for 4–5 hours, then coarsely grind it. Sauté the dal paste in oil with cumin, ginger, green chilies, and salt until dry and crumbly. Prepare rice flour dough by boiling water with a pinch of salt and slowly adding rice flour, stirring continuously until it forms a smooth dough.

Make small cups from the dough, fill them with the dal mixture, and seal them into half-moon or modak-like shapes. Steam these pithas for 10–15 minutes until cooked. Serve hot with tomato chutney or spicy pickles. This healthy, protein-rich dish is often made during festivals or winter evenings.

    <H1>Sattu Paratha </H1>
    <p>Sattu Paratha is a stuffed flatbread made with a filling of spiced roasted gram flour (sattu). The filling includes sattu, finely chopped onions, garlic, green chilies, pickle masala, mustard oil, lemon juice, ajwain, and salt. Knead wheat flour into a soft dough and make small balls. Flatten each dough ball, place a spoonful of filling, and seal it carefully before rolling into a paratha.

Cook the stuffed paratha on a tawa with ghee or oil until both sides are golden and crisp. This paratha is extremely nutritious and filling, often eaten with curd, chutney, or even plain. It’s a staple breakfast in many Bihari homes and offers a great balance of protein and flavor.</p>

Drain rice and dal, add to the cooker with enough water, and pressure cook until everything is soft and fragrant. Finish with lemon juice and fresh coriander. Tudkiya Bhath is often eaten with curd or pickle and is the Himachali version of comfort rice, mildly spiced and deeply nourishing.</p>
<br><br>
<h1>Kadhi Badi </h1>
<p>Kadhi Badi consists of soft gram flour fritters (badi) in a spiced yogurt-based curry. For the badi, make a thick batter with besan (gram flour), salt, turmeric, ajwain, and a pinch of baking soda. Fry small spoonfuls in hot oil until golden. For the kadhi, whisk yogurt with water, besan, turmeric, salt, and bring it to a boil while stirring continuously.

Once the kadhi thickens slightly, add the fried badis and simmer for 10–15 minutes. Prepare a tempering with mustard seeds, dry red chilies, fenugreek seeds, and hing in mustard oil, and pour it over the kadhi. Serve with plain rice for a comforting, tangy, and mildly spiced meal loved across Bihar.</p>

Steam the stuffed dough balls in a steamer or over boiling water until firm and cooked through. Siddu is usually served hot with ghee, dal, or chutney. Its warm, nutty filling and fluffy texture make it a favorite during winters</p>

<h1>Aloo Kachalu Chaat</h1>
<p>
    This is a spicy-tangy street-style potato chaat that is quick to make and full of flavor. Boil and cube potatoes, then toss them with mustard oil, black salt, regular salt, roasted cumin powder, red chili powder, green chilies, lemon juice, and tamarind pulp. Finely chopped onions and coriander add crunch and freshness.

The key to this chaat is the liberal use of mustard oil and tangy agents like tamarind or lemon, giving it a sharp Bihari flavor profile. It's often eaten as a light evening snack or served during roadside gatherings, especially in Mithila and Patna regions.

<h1>Ghugni</h1>
<p>Ghugni is a spiced yellow peas curry popular in Bihar and neighboring states. Soak dried yellow peas overnight and boil them until soft. In a pan, heat mustard oil, add bay leaf, cumin, chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Once golden, add tomatoes, turmeric, red chili powder, and garam masala. Cook until the oil separates.

Add the boiled peas along with their water, and let the curry simmer until it thickens. Adjust seasoning and garnish with coriander and a dash of lemon juice. Ghugni can be served alone, with flattened rice (poha), or as a side with litti or paratha, making it both a snack and a main dish.</p>
