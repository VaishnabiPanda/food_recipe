    <h1>Dhokla (Steamed Gram Flour Cake)</h1>
    <p>Dhokla is a light and spongy savory cake made from gram flour (besan). To prepare, mix 1 cup of besan with 1 tbsp semolina (sooji), 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp lemon juice, salt, and water to form a smooth batter.

For the tempering, heat oil and add mustard seeds, green chilies, curry leaves, and sesame seeds. Pour this over the cooled dhokla and garnish with chopped coriander and grated coconut.

<h1>Undhiyu (Mixed Vegetable Curry)</h1>
<p>Undhiyu is a traditional Gujarati mixed vegetable dish, especially popular during winter. It includes vegetables like surti papdi (flat beans), baby potatoes, yam, brinjal, and sweet potatoes.

Sometimes curd is added for a richer taste. Pakhala is typically enjoyed with sides like fried or mashed vegetables, badi chura, roasted fish, or sautéed greens, making it a cooling and wholesome meal, especially during hot summer days</p>
