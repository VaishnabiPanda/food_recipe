    <h1>  Bamboo Shoot Curry</h1>
    <p>
        To prepare Bamboo Shoot Curry, first soak fresh or fermented bamboo shoots in water for a few hours to reduce their sourness and bitterness. Drain the shoots and boil them for about 10 minutes, then set aside. In a pan, heat oil and sauté chopped garlic, ginger, and onions until golden brown. Add sliced green chilies and stir well. Now add bite-sized pork or chicken pieces and cook until they start browning.

Add the boiled bamboo shoots, a pinch of turmeric, and salt to taste. Pour enough water to cover the ingredients and let the curry simmer for 20–30 minutes, or until the meat becomes tender and the flavors meld. You can add a bit of king chili or fermented soybean for extra flavor, depending on your taste. Serve hot with steamed rice.

<h1>Thukpa (Noodle Soup)</h1>
<p>
 Start by boiling noodles (usually wheat or rice noodles) until just cooked, then drain and set aside. In a pot, heat oil and sauté finely chopped garlic, ginger, onions, and green chilies. Add chopped vegetables like carrots, cabbage, and spinach. For non-vegetarians, small chicken or beef pieces can be added and cooked until tender. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft.

Pour water or chicken stock into the pot, season with salt and pepper, and let it boil. Once the broth is flavorful, add the cooked noodles and simmer for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped spring onions and fresh coriander. Thukpa is best served hot and is a perfect comfort food in cold weather.

    <H1>Momos (Dumplings) </H1>
    <p>Prepare the dough by mixing all-purpose flour with water and a pinch of salt, kneading until smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling using minced meat (pork, chicken, or beef) or finely chopped vegetables. Mix with chopped onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies, coriander, and salt.

Roll out the dough into small circles, place a spoonful of filling in the center, fold and pleat the edges, then seal. Steam the momos in a steamer for about 15–20 minutes or until they turn translucent and firm. Serve hot with spicy tomato chutney or a fermented chili dip.

<h1> Lukter (Smoked Meat with Chili Flakes)</h1>
<p>To make Lukter, first dry or smoke strips of beef or pork until firm and flavorful. You can also use pre-smoked meat available in local markets. Chop the meat into bite-sized pieces or shred it depending on preference.

In a small pan, roast dry red chilies until slightly blackened, then crush them coarsely using a mortar and pestle. Mix the meat with the chili flakes and add a bit of salt. Optionally, you can add finely chopped onions or fermented soybean for added texture. Lukter is typically eaten with steamed rice as a spicy side dish.</p>

Steam the stuffed dough balls in a steamer or over boiling water until firm and cooked through. Siddu is usually served hot with ghee, dal, or chutney. Its warm, nutty filling and fluffy texture make it a favorite during winters</p>
<br><br>
<h1> Pehak (Fermented Soybean Chutney)</h1>
<p>
    Soak soybeans overnight and boil them until soft. Drain and let them ferment for a few days in a warm place until they develop a strong, tangy aroma. Once fermented, mash the soybeans into a coarse paste.

Add roasted green or red chilies, garlic cloves, and a pinch of salt. Grind everything together to form a thick, spicy chutney. Some people add a drop of mustard oil or chopped onions for flavor. Pehak is usually served with rice and meat dishes to add a pungent kick.

<h1>Apong (Rice Beer)</h1>
<p>
    Apong is made using fermented rice. First, cook rice (preferably sticky rice or local varieties) and spread it out on a clean mat to cool. Add a fermentation starter (yeast cake or starter herbs), then mix thoroughly. Transfer the mixture to a clean clay or glass container.

Seal the container and leave it in a warm place to ferment for about 5–7 days. Once fermentation is complete, the liquid can be strained and stored. Apong is mildly alcoholic and has a sweet, sour flavor. It's served during festivals and social gatherings in bamboo mugs or metal cups.
