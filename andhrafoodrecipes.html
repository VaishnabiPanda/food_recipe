    <H1>PULIHARA</H1>
    <P>Pulihora is a tangy, spicy rice dish made with tamarind pulp, rice, and a tempering of mustard seeds, chilies, curry leaves, and lentils. To make it, first soak a lemon-sized ball of tamarind in warm water and extract a thick pulp. Cook 1 cup of rice, spread it on a plate, and allow it to cool. In a pan, heat 2 tbsp of oil and add mustard seeds, dry red chilies, curry leaves, chana dal, and urad dal. Once they start to splutter and turn golden, add green chilies, turmeric, and the tamarind pulp. Cook this mixture on low heat until the raw smell disappears and it thickens. Add salt and jaggery to balance the flavors.

Mix the prepared tamarind paste with the cooled rice thoroughly. Adjust the salt and tanginess to your taste. Let it rest for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to soak in. Pulihora is often served as a prasadam (offering) in temples and is also a popular dish during festivals and travel meals due to its shelf-stability. You can garnish it with roasted peanuts or cashews for extra crunch.</P>

    <H1>DONDAKAYA FRY</H1>
    <P>Dondakaya Fry is a quick and tasty stir-fry made with ivy gourd (also known as tindora), which is sliced thinly and sautéed with spices until crisp. Wash and slice 250 grams of ivy gourd into thin rounds or strips. In a hot pan, add 2 tbsp of oil, and then mustard seeds, cumin seeds, urad dal, and curry leaves. Once they splutter, add the sliced ivy gourd and sauté for 5 minutes on medium-high heat. Add turmeric, red chili powder, salt, and a pinch of garam masala.

Continue frying until the dondakaya becomes slightly crispy and cooked through, which may take about 10–15 minutes. Stir occasionally to avoid burning. Optional additions include grated coconut or crushed roasted peanuts toward the end. Dondakaya fry pairs beautifully with hot rice and dal or chapati, and is a staple in many Telugu households</P>

    <H1>GONGURA PICKLE</H1>
    <P>Gongura Pickle is a spicy and tangy Andhra-style chutney made from gongura (sorrel) leaves. First, pluck and wash 2 cups of fresh gongura leaves, drain, and dry them thoroughly.

In the same pan, roast 1 tsp fenugreek seeds, 1 tbsp coriander seeds, and 4–6 red chilies until fragrant. Grind the cooled leaves and spices together with salt and a small amount of tamarind (optional) into a coarse paste.

In a separate tempering, heat 2 tbsp oil, splutter mustard seeds, crushed garlic, and curry leaves, and pour it over the chutney. Mix well and store in an airtight container. Gongura pickle is packed with flavor and goes excellently with plain rice, dosa, or idli. Due to its tangy taste and long shelf life, it's a popular condiment in Telugu cuisine</P>

    <P>Pesarattu is a nutritious and protein-rich dosa made from whole green gram (moong dal). Soak 1 cup of green gram and 2 tablespoons of rice for 4–6 hours or overnight.

For extra flavor, chopped onions, green chilies, and coriander leaves can be mixed in or sprinkled on top while cooking.

Heat a non-stick tawa or griddle, pour a ladle of batter, and spread it thin like a dosa. Drizzle oil around the edges and let it cook until crisp and golden.

    <P>Medu Vada is a savory South Indian fritter made from urad dal, known for its crisp outside and fluffy inside. Soak 1 cup of urad dal (black gram) for at least 4 hours. Drain and grind it into a thick, fluffy batter using very little water. Add salt, chopped onions, green chilies, ginger, curry leaves, and crushed black pepper. Beat the batter well to incorporate air and make the vadas light.

Heat oil in a deep pan. Wet your hands, take a small portion of batter, make a hole in the center, and slide it gently into the oil. Fry until golden and crisp on both sides.

Heat oil in a pan, drop spoonfuls of batter, and fry on medium heat until golden brown and crispy. Serve punugulu with spicy peanut or coconut chutney. These are a popular street snack in Andhra Pradesh and are quick to make from leftover batter.</P>

    <H1>CURD RICE</H1>
    <P>Curd Rice is a comforting South Indian dish made by mixing cooked rice with yogurt and tempered spices. Cook 1 cup of rice until very soft. Let it cool, then mash slightly and mix with 1.5 to 2 cups of fresh curd. Add salt and a splash of milk to prevent the curd from turning sour. Optionally, mix in grated carrots, pomegranate seeds, or chopped cucumber for texture.

For tempering, heat 1 tsp oil and splutter mustard seeds, urad dal, chopped green chilies, ginger, and curry leaves. Pour this over the curd rice and mix well. Garnish with coriander leaves. Curd rice is best served chilled or at room temperature and is perfect as a cooling meal, especially in hot weather or after a spicy meal</P>
