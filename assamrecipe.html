    <h1> Khar</h1>
    <p>
       Khar is a signature Assamese dish made with raw papaya, pulses, and a special ingredient called khar, which is filtered water from sun-dried banana peel ash. To make it, sun-dried banana peels are burnt to ash, and the ash is then mixed with water and strained. Raw papaya is chopped and boiled, then cooked with black gram dal or pulses in mustard oil, along with the filtered khar water.

The mixture is gently simmered until the papaya and dal absorb the earthy, alkaline flavor. It's seasoned with salt and sometimes bay leaves for a mild aroma. Khar is eaten at the beginning of meals and is believed to help with digestion. Though simple, the unique flavor of khar gives this dish its cultural and culinary importance in Assamese homes.
